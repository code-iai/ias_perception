    An extended and optimized implementation of the state-of-theart
    local curve fitting algorithm named Contracting Curve Density (CCD) algorithm, originally
    developed by Hanek et al. 
    The CCD algorithm can be best described as follows. Given one or multiple images as
    input data and a parametric curve model with a priori distribution of model parameters,
    through curve-fitting process, we estimate the model parameters which determine the approximation
    of the posterior distribution in order to make the curve models best matching
    the image data. In order to improve the stability, accuracy and robustness over the original
    implementation we introduce the following improvements. Firstly, we use the logistic
    sigmoid function instead of a Gaussian error function which renders a curve-fitting problem
    as a Gaussian logistic regression problem known in the field of pattern recognition.
    Secondly, a quadratic or a cubic B-spline curve is used to model the parametric curve to
    avoid the Runge phenomenon without increasing the degree of the B-spline. Thirdly, the
    system supports both planar affine (6-DOF) and three-dimensional affine (8-DOF) shapespace.
    The latter affine space can avoid curve mismatching caused by major viewpoint
    changes. Lastly, in order to avoid manual intervention by the user, the developed system
    also supports robust global initial curve initialization modules based on both keypoint
    feature matching and back-projections from the 3D point clouds.
