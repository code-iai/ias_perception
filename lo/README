Located Objects (short lo)
Author: Ulrich Friedrich Klank

This library enables a purely movement based synchronization of Location
Data.

It provides a simple interface that can keeps track of movements and newly
apearing objects in order to be able to infer any relative position at the
moment.

This library depends on libxml2

Implementation of a ros service that provides this tool to network
participants can be found in the pacakge 'jlo'.
An implemetation of such an participant linking against lo can be found in
the package 'cop'
An implementation of such an participant being independant of lo can be
found in the package 'test_client' (e.g. query_jlo)
